tempSrvr
========
tempSrvr is a web application thought to show measured temperature
values submitted by sensors via HTTP.

Posting new values is only allowed for sensors which are able to
authenticate themself. Managing the sensors is only possible for
authenticated users.
However, it's possible to publish the collected temperatures.
